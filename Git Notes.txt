DOING GIT ON GITHUB (REMOTE)

tell git that we have a remote repo on github
git remote add origin https://github.com/so-rockstar/Story.git
origin can be anything but just keep origin for convention
paste url for github

once established, push directory to online repo ("origin" is the name)
git push -u origin master
(so replace origin in this line with whatever is used in the one before)

files now online
